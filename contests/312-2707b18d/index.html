<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Rujia Liu. I used to do a lot of problem solving and problemsetting, but after graduated from Tsinghua University, I'm spending more and more time on my company :(</p>

<p>(You may realized that the paragraph above is copied from the texts of my 3rd, 4th and 5th contest, but that's me, lazy me.)</p>

<p>This time, my contest is all about myself. Every problem has a short story that is related to me. If you're interested, you can ask me (rujia.liu@gmail.com) :) </p>

<p>This is a very important birthday for me, so I really want you enjoy this contest and know more about me. Please feel free to email me if you're interested in some non-algorithmic aspects of this contest (e.g. where to find the games I mentioned in the problems).</p>

<p>Ah, forgot to mention, problem A, B, C and K are good starts :)</p>
