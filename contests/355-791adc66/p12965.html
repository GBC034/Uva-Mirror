<h2><a name="SECTION1"><font color="#0070e8">Context</font></a></h2>
<p>Deciding the price of a product is not an easy matter. If the
price is high, then consumers get angry because they think it is too
expensive. But if the price is low, then producers get angry because they
do not earn enough money.</p>
<p>In this problem, you have to bid for the price that produces
the minimum number of angry people.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION1"><font color="#0070e8">The
Problem</font></a></h2>
<p>For a given product, we have a set of producers and a set of
consumers. Each producer has suggested his/her ideal price for the
product. If your bid is below that ideal price, then the producer will
get angry. Also, each consumer has suggested his/her ideal price for
the product. If your bid is above that ideal price, then the consumer
will get angry.</p>
<p>You have to find the price that produces the minimum number
of angry people (either producers or consumers). Your bid price should
always be
between 0 and 10<sup>9</sup>. And if there is more than one
optimal solution, you have to output the lowest one.
</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION2"><font color="#0070e8">The
Input</font></a></h2>
<p>The input consists of a series of test cases. The first line
contains a number that indicates the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case consists of three lines. The first one contains
two
integers, <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>,
indicating the number of producers and consumers of the product,
respectively. These numbers will be between 0 and 10<sup>4</sup>.
Then, the second line contains <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span>
integer numbers, the ideal prices for the producers. And the third line
contains <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>
integer numbers, the ideal prices for the consumers. The prices are
between 1 and 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION2"><font color="#0070e8">The
Output</font></a></h2>
<p> For each input case, you have to output two numbers separated
by one space: the bid price that
produces the minimum number of angry people; and the total number of
angry people for that price. Remember
that if there is more than one optimal solution, you have to output the
one with lowest price; and the result cannot be a negative number.</p>
