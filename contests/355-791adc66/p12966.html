<h2><font color="#0070e8">The Problem</font></h2>
<p>You need to find the best strategy to win a game. In this
game, a board is divided into squares arranged in a square grid (like a
chessboard, but the number of squares may be different from 64). Each
square has a number between 0 and 9 in it, which indicates its value.</p>
<p>A
chess bishop starts in a given square and you have to move it a number
of times (<em>l</em>) diagonally (as in chess, it should
move the same distance vertically and horizontally). Each time, you win
the number of points of the destination square.</p>
<p>For example, for the following board:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 327px; height: 305px;" alt="Example" src="p12966.png">
</div>
<p>Starting at the circled square and with 4 moves, the blue path
earns 17 points. On the other hand, the green path obtains 36 points,
which is the maximum in this case.</p>
<p>The program will receive the size of the board, the number of
moves (<em>l</em>), and the coordinates of the starting
square. It should calculate the maximum number of points that can be
won from the starting square in <em>l</em> moves.</p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8">The Input</font></h2>
<p>The input format is as follows:</p>
<p>An integer in a single line which says the number of problems
to solve. Then, for each problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two integers in a line separated by a space indicating the
width of the board (<em>n</em>) and the number of moves (<em>l</em>).
The height of the board is always the same as its width.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two integers in a line separated by a space indicating the
horizontal and vertical coordinates, respectively, of the starting
square. Coordinates start at 0 at the top left corner and increase
rightwards and downwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>n</em> rows of <em>n</em>
numbers each indicating the value of each square.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <em>n</em> and <em>l</em> are
less or equal than 50.</p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8">The Output</font></h2>
<p>For each problem, a line with a single number indicating the
maximum amount of points that can be obtained doing <em>l</em>
moves starting from the given square.</p>
