<p style="color:red;padding:10px;background-color:#ffdddd;border-radius:10px;text-align:justify;font-family:'Arial';"><b>IMPORTANT</b><br/><br/>We're still experiencing some technique difficulties with some of the interactive problems. However, the server codes contained in the gift package should make you happy solving these problems without submitting a lot. While we hope we can fix the problems ASAP, if you think your correct code is being rejected, please send a clarification request to <a href="mailto:clarify@onlinejudge.org">clarify@onlinejudge.org</a>.<br/><br/>At this moment, problems <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b> and <b>J</b> are known to fail, so we recommend not submitting them. Also, a 'Time limit exceeded' verdict does not necessarily mean CPU time limit exceeded, it might be a lack of communication between submission and server at some point. Keep an eye on this page for updates on the issue.</p>

<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Rujia Liu. I used to do a lot of problem solving and problemsetting, but after graduated from Tsinghua University, I'm spending more and more time on my company :(</p>

<p>(You may realized that the paragraph above is copied from the texts of my 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th contest, but that's me, lazy me.)</p>

<p>This time, my contest is about interactive problems. It's the first contest that UVa uses interactive problems. Actually UVa decided to add support for interactive problems after my contest proposal. Thanks, UVa team!</p>

<p><strong>However, Java support is still not yet finished. So please code in C, C++ or Pascal during the contest. Sorry for that!</strong></p>

<p>I guess interactive problems are new to many of you, so I used some classic problems for you to warmup, before trying the difficult ones. 
Other interactive problems are authored by me quite a few years ago, for Chinese Olympiad in Informatics, 
so if you've solved these problems before, please don't submit immediately :)</p>

<p>I've also included two traditional problems so that if you hate interactive problems, you still have something to do. 
However, be careful: one of them is very hard, and the other one is even harder...</p>

<p>Ah, forgot to mention, problem B, D and E are good starts :)</p>

<hr />

<p>As usual, there is a gift package on the contest website that contains some additional I/O data, special judge, all the server codes for each interactive problem, and a sample interactive problem 'Guess the Number' with server codes and client codes in C++, Pascal and Java. Please make best use of it :)</p>

<p>Thanks Md. Mahbubul Hasan for all the problems, Yubin Wang for problem C, F and L, Lijie Chen for problem L, Feng Chen for writing and testing Java codes for some of the problems and finally, Miguel Revilla Rodr√≠guez for integrating interactive problems into UVa OJ :)</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this unique contest, and interactive problems :)</p>
