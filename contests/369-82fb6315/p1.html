<h2><font color="#0070e8">Context</font></h2>
<p>Over the past 50 years, about half the world's original forest
cover has been lost. It is time to help with the reforestation of the
planet and plant more trees!</p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8">The Problem</font></h2>
<p>We have been entrusted with the mission of planting trees and
watch how they
grow. The kind of trees that we have to plant and observe is known as a
mathematical tree. These trees have the following characteristics. On each
level, as depicted in the figure below, the tree decides whether
branching or
not in each subtree, depending on these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the level 1, it never branches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the tree (or subtree) does not branch at the level i,
then it will branch at the level i+1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the tree (or subtree) branches at the level i, then
only one of the two resulting branches will branch at the level i+1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img style="width: 298px; height: 213px;" alt="Mathematical tree" src="mat-tree.png"><br>
<em>Example of a mathematical tree.</em></p>
<p>Leaves appear at the end of each branch on the last level of
the
tree. Your task, while observing the tree, is to count the number of
leaves that the tree has in a particular level of growth,
assuming that
branches will never merge. However, you do not want to spend all your
time counting the leaves by hand, so you want to create a program that
tells you the number of leaves at any given level of growth.</p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8">The Input</font></h2>
<p>Your program receives a sequence of positive integers, one per
line, each representing the level of growth of the tree you are
observing. The
maximum value for the level is 85. The input terminates with a 0.</p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8">The Output</font></h2>
<p>For each input case, your program must print the corresponding
number of leaves that the tree has in such level.</p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8">Sample Input</font><br>
</h2>
<pre>2<br>3<br>4<br>0<br></pre>
<h2><font color="#0070e8">Sample Output</font></h2>
